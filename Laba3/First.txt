In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in Fulham with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough,

the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered. Chelsea F.C. was 

founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present - day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.
